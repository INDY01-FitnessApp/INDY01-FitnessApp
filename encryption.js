Select points of encryption/decryption and which data needs to be encrypted/decrypted
Identify methods of encrytion
For each method:
- Describe how it works
- Implement it in the system
- Analyze security vs. complexity

Encryption methods
Symmetric: quicker, best suited to larger datasets, smaller cyphertexts
Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) - most frequently used
Blowfish (TDES) - less secure than AES

Asymmetric: slower, best suited to larger datasets, larger cyphertexts - public and private key
Rivest Shamir Adleman (used by HTTPS, so used by Firebase)
Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)
